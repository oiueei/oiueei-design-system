## OIUEEI Design System

This is an experiment to use a design system based on the fabulous [design system developed for the city of Helsinki](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/helsinki-design-system/)]. The idea is to adapt it to specific needs but not lose the base created by the HDS team and the subsequent updates. This "new" design system will also be available under the MIT license.
